Remote control system for legacy window shutter actuators.

ShadIT is a web API server you can install on Raspberry Pi
(or similar embedded computers) to remote control electric
window shutters.

Such shutters are usually operated by mechanical
switches, but you really don't want to move away from your
desk when the sun is shining into your face, do you?

No fancy web interface is provided, only a simple web API,
served by a small Go program.
