Remote control system for legacy window blind actuators.

ShadIT is a web API server you can install on Raspberry Pi
(or similar embedded computers) to remote control electric
window blinds. Such blinds are usually operated by mechanical
switches, which can be cumbersome for IT professionals.

You really don't want to move away from your desk when the
sun is shining into your face, do you?

No fancy web interface is provided, only a simple web API,
served by a small Go program.
